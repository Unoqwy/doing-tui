# doing-tui

A TUI tool to keep track of what you've done and how much time it took. It does **not** provide TODO lists.

## Usage

**Tags** are used to organize different projects or extra metadata.
For example you can create a tag `work` and occasionally complement tasks with another tag `meetings`.

**Projects** are directories of tasks. They can be associated with one or more default tags.

**Tasks** are things you did and the time they took. Zero, one, or many entries can be associated with it.

**Entries** are specific time periods that can be recorded automatically.
